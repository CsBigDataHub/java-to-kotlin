# 6. Classes

In Java, we define a model class and accompany them with standard setters and getters:

```Java
package com.opengiineer;

public class Person {

    private long id;
    private String name;
    private String brand;
    private long price;

    // setters and getters
}
```

In Kotlin, getters and setters are autogenerated:

```Java
package com.opengiineer

class Person {
  var id: Long = 0
  var name: String? = null
  var brand: String? = null
  var price: Long = 0
}
```

#### Modification of getter/setter visibility can also be changed, but keep in mind that the getter’s visibility must be the same as the property’s visibility.

In Kotlin, every class comes with the following methods \(can be overridden\):

* toString \(readable string representation for an object\)
* hashCode \(provides a unique identifier for an object\)
* equals \(used to compare two objects from the same class to see if they are the same\)
